# Iris Flowers Classification ML Project
This project is a classic example of supervised machine learning and is often considered the “Hello World” of Machine Learning. The dataset contains various features of three different species of Iris flowers - Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to predict the species of the iris flower based on its features.

## Dataset
The dataset contains 150 samples, with 50 samples for each of the three species. Each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset is available at the following link:

## Approach
This project will use the popular sci-kit-learn library to train and test our model. We will first load the dataset, visualize it, and then split it into training and testing sets. We will then train different machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest, and compare their performance. Finally, we will select the best model and evaluate its performance on the test set.

## Results
After evaluating different models, we will select the best-performing model, which will be able to predict the species of the iris flower with a high level of accuracy.

## Conclusion
This project is an excellent starting point for beginners in machine learning, as it helps understand how to load and handle data, visualize it, and train different models. Additionally, it is a small dataset, which makes it easier to experiment with different models without requiring special transformations or scaling capabilities.
